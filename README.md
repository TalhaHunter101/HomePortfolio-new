## Starting HomePortfolio Project

This guide will help you set up and run an Homeportfolio Next.js project locally.

---

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

### 1. **Node.js**
- **Version**: LTS version recommended
- To check if Node.js is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  node -v
  ```

  If it's not installed, download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **Version**: Comes with Node.js by default.
- To check if npm is installed, run:

  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```

  If npm is not installed, it will be installed automatically with Node.js.





### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages for the project to run.

## Running the Next.js Project

### Step 1: Start the Development Server

To start the project in development mode, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on the default port `3000`. You can access the application by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 2: Building for Production

If you want to build the project for production, you can run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build of your Next.js app.

### Step 3: Running the Production Build

After building the project, you can run it in production mode with:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the project on the default port `3000`, and you can access it at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
